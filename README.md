## Overview

This repository contains the final capstone project for the <strong>B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</strong>. The project focuses on using deep learning techniques, particularly with the <strong>EfficientNet</strong> architecture, to automatically classify degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine from MR images. The dataset used is provided by the RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification competition on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification">Kaggle</a>.

## Dataset

The dataset includes multi-view MR images (sagittal and axial views) of the lumbar spine, with corresponding labels for various degenerative conditions. The labels include:

- Left Neural Foraminal Narrowing
- Left Subarticular Stenosis
- Right Neural Foraminal Narrowing
- Right Subarticular Stenosis
- Spinal Canal Stenosis

Due to the size of the dataset (>7GB), the data itself is not included in this repository. Please follow the instructions below to download the dataset.
